# Ray Tracing Journey
## A repository to explore ray tracing and path tracers
## Initially focusing on the Ray Tracing series

## For BasicRayTracing branch:
### [Ray Tracing in One Weekend â€” The Book Series](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

## Goal of this repository is to create a collection of ray tracing and path tracing techniques, ranging from basic to sophisticated implementations
## Each branch will contain a different project of a ray tracer
